# temporary_junk_cleaner
Simple script that cleans all temporary files on start_up automatically, specially for lazy users like me who can't be bothered with cleaning temporary at regular interval from there systems(Windows User)
just copy the exe file to "C:\Users\<user_name>\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs\Startup"
